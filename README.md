# Alarm_clock_using_tkinter
User can set up a scheduled alarm in 24 hr format

Using the Tkinter I have created the GUI application where a user can set up an alarm on his choice of specific day, it rings using a playsound module and also gives you a text as “it’s time to wake up” when the time meets the setup time.

User can use it for daily purpose.
